description = "NOMADIK TERMINAL is a mobile-first, crypto trading toolkit built for survivalists, digital nomads, and tactical traders. Designed to run inside Termux on Android, it deploys algorithmic strategies like RSI and EMA crossover through the open-source Freqtrade engine. With multi-exchange support (BinanceUS, KuCoin), Telegram alerts, and a fuzzily-navigable command-line interface, this tool transforms your phone into a field-ready trading terminal. It installs with one command, runs in a clean virtual environment, and includes branded shortcuts, log rotation, and strategy templates you can evolve or swap on the fly."
