You're in the middle of writing the README.md file interactively using cat > README.md << 'EOF', and it’s waiting for you to finish the input.

✅ How to Finish the File
To complete the file and exit cleanly:

Paste the rest of the README content (everything after bash install.sh)

Then on a new line, type:

EOF
Press Enter

That will close the input and save the file.

🔄 Then Push to GitHub
Once the file is saved, run:

bash
git add README.md
git commit -m "Finalize README.md with tactical branding and launch instructions"
git push origin main
Let me know once it’s pushed and I’ll generate your CONTRIBUTING.md next. You’re deploying like a tactician.
